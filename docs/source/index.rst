Jam Launch
############

Jam Launch is a platform for developing multiplayer games and experiences with
the Godot game engine. It takes the guesswork and complexity out of cloud
hosting and network configuration so that you can focus on making your game.

Deploying games with Jam Launch requires a paid developer subscription, but
there are low-commitment ways of trying it out. Additionally, we offer full
refunds if you discover that Jam Launch is not a good fit for your project.
Finally, even if you are not interested in the full suite of Jam Launch
features, you are welcome to use and repurpose the multiplayer functionality in
the open-sourced
`Jam Launch addon <https://github.com/jam-launch/jam-launch-addon>`_ and
`example project <https://github.com/jam-launch/jam-launch-example>`_.
