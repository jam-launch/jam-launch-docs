Overview
===========================

The goal of Jam Launch is to get your multiplayer game built, tested, and
deployed as quickly as possible. Specifically, it provides:

* **Cloud infrastructure bootstrapping**
    * OpenID-based authentication for players, testers, and developers
    * In-editor game publishing
    * Game distribution and web player hosting
    * Game session provisioning
    * Cloud-based game data persistence and querying
* **Pre-built multiplayer components** - the open source example projects and
  addon provide reusable Godot components that can be used to jump-start any
  Godot multiplayer game project. One of the goals for 2024 is to expand these
  into a more comprehensive library.
